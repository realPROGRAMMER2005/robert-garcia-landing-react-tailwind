                    I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting opportunities. 
                    Has Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to focus on accessibility when developing. 
                    Passionate and curious about solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow and a bit of Designing. 
                    While I am not programming, I enjoy playing football, photography and playing Valorant. 
                    Learning more to improve skill.
